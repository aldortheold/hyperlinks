                <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a> <label>and </label> <a href="https://pages.github.com " target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> â€”
                these are services that provide the ability to host static websites for free. They also have paid
                tariff plans that provide additional features and opportunities for commercial use.
            </p>
            <p>
                To commercially implement a Wordle project using Netlify and GitHub Pages, follow these steps:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Set up a project repository on GitHub or use an existing one. <label>Place all the necessary files
                upload the project to the </label> repository, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images and other resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Create a Netlify account and link it to your GitHub repository. Netlify will automatically link
                your repository is with a service that will allow you to automatically deploy and update your website on Netlify with
                each new commit to the repository.

            <p>
                3. Configure the build of your project on Net life by specifying the entry point (for example, index.html ) and other build settings,
                if necessary. Net life provides various tools for building and processing projects, such as <label>code compression,
                image optimization and others</label>. You can set up build scripts if required for your project.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Set the <label>domain name</label> for your website so that it is accessible by its own name instead of the Netlify address.
                Net life provides the opportunity to use your own domain names or offers a temporary domain name.
                If you want to use your own domain name, you will need to configure your domain's DNS records for
                instructions for Netlify servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Adjust the security and access settings for your website on Net life. You can set up an SSL certificate for
                to ensure a secure connection to your website, set up authentication or perform other settings
                security, if necessary for your project.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Test your website on Net life, make sure everything is working properly. Check that your JavaScript logic is
                it is executed correctly and any functions of the game work stably.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. After successful testing, you can switch to the Netlify paid data plan to get additional
                features such as a faster Content Delivery Network (CDN), customizable domain names, advanced features
                monitoring and others.
            </p>
            <p>
                By that point, your project will be fully deployed and accessible by your chosen domain name via Netlify.
                You will be able to commercially implement your Wordle project by attracting visitors, offering services, products or solutions,
                and earning income through your website.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the game you can <label> develop a paid subscription system, place third-party advertising or attract
                there are investors in it</label>.
