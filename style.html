                The stylistic design of the classic Wordle game from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html " target="_blank">New York Times</a> can be described as follows:
            </p>

            <h3>1. The color palette:</h3>
            <p>
                • For the background color, a light gray (or dark gray for a dark theme) shade is used, which creates
                a neutral and pleasant base for the game<br>
                • The color scheme for the letters includes bright and saturated colors, which makes them easily distinguishable against the background
                • Incorrect letters are marked with graphic elements or shades other than the correct letters. It helps the players
                to see that they have chosen the wrong letter
            </p>
            <h3>2. Font styling:</h3>
            <p>
                • Headings and titles are displayed using a clean and simple sans-serif font<br>
                • Usually <span>Arial or Helvetica</span> is used as the font. They give the game a modern and stylish look
            </p>
            <h3>3. Graphical design:</h3>
            <p>
                • The graphics are focused on the game itself. For example, there are no unnecessary visual elements or complex<br>
                animations that can distract players from the essence of the game<br>
                • The playing field is a rectangle divided into cells, where each cell contains one letter. Each letter
                It is displayed clearly and clearly, which helps players to easily recognize and select letters.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Wordle style design from the New York Times should serve as a reference when creating a page style. It's elegant,
                minimalistic and professional. However, everyone's tastes are different, and the theme of each particular clone may differ.
                Therefore, it is difficult to provide a code standard that meets all the conditions.
