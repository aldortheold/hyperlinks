            <h3>Step 1: Creating a new HTML file</h3>
            <p>
                You need to start by creating a new HTML file that will contain the structure of the Wordle game. For
                any development environment is suitable for editing code, but the most common editor at the moment is
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 2: Configuring the basic HTML structure</h3>
            <p id="p2">
                To set up the basic HTML structure, add the following code to the file:
                <span>
                    <span id="grey">&lt;</span>!DOCTYPE <span id="blue">html</span><span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                    <span id="grey">&lt;</span>html<span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="grey">&lt;</span>head<span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="grey">&lt;</span>meta <span id="blue">charset</span><span id="white">=</span><span id="orange">"UTF-8"</span><span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="grey">&lt;</span>meta <span id="blue">name</span><span id="white">=</span><span id="orange">"viewport"</span> <span id="blue">content</span><span id="white">=</span><span id="orange">"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</span><span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="grey">&lt;</span>title<span id="grey">&gt;</span><span id="white">Wordle</span><span id="grey">&lt;/</span>title<span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="grey">&lt;</span>style<span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="green">/* Place for CSS styles (better separate them into a single file) */</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="grey">&lt;/</span>style<span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="grey">&lt;/</span>head<span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="grey">&lt;</span>body<span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="green">&lt;!-- Place for game structure --&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="grey">&lt;/</span>body<span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                    <span id="grey">&lt;/</span>html<span id="grey">&gt;</span><br>
                </span>
            </p>
            <h3>Step 3: Adding all the necessary elements</h3>
            <p>
                The standard Wordle has a simple and intuitive appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main page of the page usually consists of the Wordle logo, which is located at the top of the page and can
                be clickable to go to the main screen of the game. Under the logo there is usually a playing field consisting of
                out of six rows of 5 squares, there are lines for guessing the word.
            </p>
            <p id="p_span1">
                The player must guess this word using hints. As the game progresses, the color of the square will have to change according to
                with the rules. The most convenient way to represent a square is as a <span id="grey"></span><span id="dark blue">label</span><span id="grey"></span> element.
            </p>
            <p>
                There may also be a timer on the main screen that shows how much time is left until the end of the game
                or it took to complete it. However, the classic Wordle does not have a timer, focusing on data analysis.
                There are much more games.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design of the page can be bright, using colorful elements and effects, or it can be more
                stylized and minimalistic, using calm backgrounds and color schemes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the page may include various additional features such as a rating system, a leaderboard,
                where players can see their results and compare them with other players, and the opportunity to share the results
                games on social networks or send them to friends.
